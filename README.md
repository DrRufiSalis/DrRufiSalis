About me: environmental scientist convinced that we won’t magically save the world tomorrow. The path to more sustainable societies should be studied by pluridisciplinary working groups that acknowledge the complex metabolism of cities and ecosystems and that develop their work and research for the general audience. My aim is to contribute to this process.
